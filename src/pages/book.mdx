    # Book

    I released my first book, __From PHP to Python: A Straight-to-the-Point Guide__ in May 2023.

    It's the best shortcut to learn Python if you already know PHP. It was written with senior PHP developers in mind.
    After reading the book you will be able to write Python code, write tests, learn a Python web framework like Django, and contribute to Python open-source projects.

    ## The approach

    - No bullshit. You know what a variable, a for loop, or an object is. **We will only focus on what's different.** The book is written in a concise and straight-to-the-point style.
    - The book shows **PHP** and **Python** code **side-by-side** to help you quickly understand what's going on (PHP code and Python code are highlighted differently to keep things clear).
    - It is built to be read in order and to give you all you need to master Python in a web-oriented approach.

    ## Where can I buy it?

    The book is available on [Gumroad](https://einenlum.gumroad.com/l/fromphptopython) in PDF and ePub, and on [Amazon](https://a.co/d/69A8gUg) in Kindle version.

    To be honest, you have all the reasons to buy it on Gumroad because you will get the PDF and ePub versions which are cleaner. Also, I activated the [Purchasing Power Parity](https://help.gumroad.com/article/327-purchasing-power-parity) feature there so there are chances you can buy it cheaper, and I earn more on Gumroad than on Amazon.
